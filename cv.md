In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my newlywed wife, friends, family and of course my adorable cocker spaniel. I enjoy playing board games, where I really prefer strategy games, where the key to winning is most often found in taking different outcomes into consideration and thinking ahead of time.  

My competitive nature derives from my handball experience, where I have played on a professional level. Sadly, I had to withdraw from my handball career due to injuries. Instead, I now focus on rehabilitation and fitness training.  

For relaxation, I enjoy outdoor hiking, playing guitar, reading and dancing. I also like to practice my programming skills and play around with some hobby projects.
