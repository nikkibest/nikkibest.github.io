## About Ball Balancer

Ball Balancer is a physics-based simulation game where you control a platform to balance a ball. The game features realistic physics, smooth graphics, and intuitive controls.

Built with modern C++ and compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten, this project demonstrates the power of running native C++ applications directly in the browser.

## Controls

- **Mouse**: Control the platform tilt
- **Click and Drag**: Adjust platform angle
- **GUI Controls**: Adjust physics parameters in real-time

## Technical Details

This project showcases:
- Real-time physics simulation
- OpenGL rendering compiled to WebGL
- ImGui for interactive UI controls
- Efficient C++ to WebAssembly compilation

## Source Code

The complete source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikkibest/ball-balancer).
